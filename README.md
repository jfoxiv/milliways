## The Restaurant at the End of the Universe

This was a school project. The idea was to take a preset menu, break the items down into four categories, and present them to the user. User then can order as many items as wanted, while the application keeps a running total of the bill.

For fun, I added some menu items taken from the "Hitchhiker's Guide" books by Douglas Adams.
